Time is flying and we can’t stop it. The submission deadline for EclipseCon talks and tutorials is fast approaching, i.e. Nov 19. We have been allocated a number of tutorials and talks to talk about Eclipse in the C/C++ world. If you are planning on attending EclipseCon anyway, you might as well talk while you’re there, and get some or all of your registration fee paid for. Feel free to submit any ideas you may have, no matter how crazy they are to the [EclipseCon submission system](http://www.eclipsecon.org/2008/index.php?page=submissions).
