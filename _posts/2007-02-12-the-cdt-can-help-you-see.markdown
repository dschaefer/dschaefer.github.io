Well, not really, the [NASA Vision Workbench](http://ti.arc.nasa.gov/visionworkbench/) can and [this guy](http://www.mattcolyer.com/2007/02/12/nasa-vision-workbench/) is using the CDT to work with it. After all the hard work we’ve put into the CDT, I’ll take “Eclipse’s CDT plugin (which has definitely gotten alot better)” as a compliment.
