So when you go to redefine the key sequence in Eclipse to do â€˜Build Allâ€™ make sure youâ€™re hitting the Ctrl key and not the Shift key. It explained why I couldnâ€™t define the CXXFLAGS macro in my Makefile. Instead of Ctrl-X Ctrl-M for build all, I had accidentally defined it as Shift-X Shift-M. Weird (that it let me), Cool (that I could do it), but took me a little while to figure out thatâ€™s what it was and not something wrong with my keyboard when Shift-X didnâ€™t do anything ðŸ™‚

BTW, thanks out to the guys who are contributing to the Emacs key bindings. Iâ€™m loving it! All I need to add is this Build key sequence, which Emacs doesnâ€™t define either anyway.
