I’m not sure why the EclipseCon submission system isn’t accepting this but here are the slides from my talk on the Rise and Fall and Rise of the CDT, Lessons on Building Communities. I had a lot of fun creating and presenting this talk. I guess it’s a passion of mine and people seemed to like it. The slides have few words on it and I’d be happy to give more details if you have any questions. Feel free to add comments here.
