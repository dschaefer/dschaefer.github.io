I’m sitting in the Eclipse vs. Visual Studio talk and the guy mentioned that Visual Studio has a free version. Really? So I went to look and I found this:

Express Quick Facts  
Download Size:35-70 MB per Express Edition  
Price:Visual Studio Express Editions—[Free for 1 year](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/support/faq/default.aspx#pricing)

Well they are slowly getting it.

I still would love to see better support for Windows development in Eclipse, especially C++ (obviously) and even C#, for the student/hobbyist. Hopefully someone in the community with the time and resources can step up and help us get there.
