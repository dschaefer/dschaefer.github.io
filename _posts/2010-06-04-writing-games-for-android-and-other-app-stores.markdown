title: Writing Games for Android ... and other app stores.

Tools is my passion, especially tools for native programming. Being a game developer wannabe, Iâ€™m especially excited when I see game developers using the tools I help build. And thatâ€™s one reason why Iâ€™m closely following and helping out with tooling for the Android Native Development Kit. Thereâ€™s a great community there that could really benefit from a good CDT integration, and maybe who will come help make that integration great.

At any rate, I watched Chris Pruettâ€™s session on Android game development from Google I/O and found it very educational. The first half was about technical details and tips behind Android game development, but the second half was just about good game development for mobile platforms. Itâ€™s a great view and Iâ€™ve embedded it at the end of this post.

The real game changer (sorry to use the pun ðŸ™‚ in my mind is the growth of app stores or markets. Pretty much every mobile platform vendor is creating some sort of one stop shopping experience for their devices and itâ€™s a great vehicle for app developers to quickly get their wares into the hands of paying customers. And with systems like Valveâ€™s Steam, you also get this great experience on your desktops and laptops.

The biggest advantage of markets, as Chris illustrated, is that itâ€™s also a great way to keep in touch with your customers. Customers tend to be brutally honest about what youâ€™ve provided them, and itâ€™s good to get first hand looks at that feedback. And also, thanks to the markets, itâ€™s also easy to get updates and fixes into their hands. Itâ€™s a win/win.

Anyway, itâ€™s a great view. Take a look.
