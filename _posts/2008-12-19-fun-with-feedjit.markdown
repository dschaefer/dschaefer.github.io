I’m not sure if you noticed, or are reading this blog from one of the syndication sites it gets copied too (like Planet Eclipse, or the Wind River Blog Network). But if you check back to the [original site](http://cdtdoug.blogspot.com/) and scroll down a bit, you’ll see a new panel called the FEEDJIT Live Traffic Feed. I know people express concerns about web things following them, and if I get enough negative response to it I’ll pull it off. But in the meantime, I’m spellbound by this feature.

I’m learning quite a lot about the audience for this blog. The traffic feed gives me the city that where the person was, which is spread throughout the world, as well as a hint at how they got to my site. A few people come directly, I guess from an RSS reader where they’ve subscribed one way or another (Thank you!). More often, though, people end up here based on google searches, and I get the snippet that they were searching for! Creepy, but very useful.

So what are people searching for that pulls up my site? Well a lot of it lately has been the topics I’m most interested in lately, and that’s CDT for Windows development, including Windows cross to Linux. It’s good to see the interest from the community on that and I am continuing working on Wascana 1.0 as I write this (SDL is building in the background). I also often get a few queries on the Subversion Eclipse plug-in wars (I hate both right now, go git!). And you get the odd one looking for help, like today’s “eclipse CDT autocomplete crap” (yeah, it has issues if you’re environment isn’t set up).

Anyway, it’s pretty interesting to watch, and it humbles me immensely to see people from around the world reading what I write, especially when the google search reveals they searched for me by name. But I love to write and share my thoughts and I really appreciate it when people leave comments. Whether I agree with them or not, I always learn something from what they put there. It’s a lot of fun and I encourage everyone to do the same. There will always be someone out there interested in what you have to say.
