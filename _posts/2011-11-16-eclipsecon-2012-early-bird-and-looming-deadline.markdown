We’ve had a really good first round of submissions and I have to admit I was overwhelmed by the number that we received. It was awesome and thanks to those who’ve already submitted. Of course there’s always need for more and you have until Friday night to get them in. There are still a few gaps that need to be filled, like tutorials, and we’re always interested in new things we haven’t thought about.

<div></div><div>To highlight the kind of talks we like, we’ve selected 5 early bird sessions. We’re big on technical talks since that’s what we hear you want to see most. We’re also very interested in talks that help us think about our community and ways of working better with them and achieving growth. Here’s the golden five. Only a hundred or so more to go :).</div><div>- [OSGi on Rails](http://www.eclipsecon.org/2012/sessions/osgi-rails) – a cool look at how the Eclipse run-times are being used with the Swiss railways.
- [The Eclipse 4 Application Platform Explained](http://www.eclipsecon.org/2012/sessions/eclipse-4-application-platform-explained) – an important talk from Tom Schindl on everything you need to know to build Eclipse 4 apps.
- [Xtext Success Story at Google](http://www.eclipsecon.org/2012/sessions/xtext-success-story-google) – a case study on how Xtext is being used for good at Google.
- [Language Tooling in Orion](http://www.eclipsecon.org/2012/sessions/language-tooling-orion) – a look at the current state of tooling in Eclipse’s development platform on the web.
- [Assholes are killing your project](http://www.eclipsecon.org/2012/sessions/assholes-are-killing-your-project)  – an important look at how personalities can affect the health of your community and what to do about it.

We’re looking forward to additional great talks we’ll see in the submission system. Get yours in today!
