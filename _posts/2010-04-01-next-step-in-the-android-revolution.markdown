I was wondering what they were going to do with all that. It could be a pretty powerful tool.</div><div></div><div>Well, we finally learned today. Google has announced the next step in the Android revolution, Google Robot. They’ve been working on a robotics project and have Android running on a Beagleboard that animates the Android at the Googleplex. They’ve also been able to reduce all human knowledge onto a single SD card that is plugged into the board and the Android has come to life.</div><div></div><div>As it turns out, it’s a pretty smart and powerful robot and has set it’s sights on taking over all governments in the world. It’s hard to argue with the strategy. At least they aren’t using that knowledge for evil.</div><div></div><div>I love Android on my Nexus One. I love Android running in Google Robot. I for one welcome our new robot overlord. All hail our new benevolent leader!</div>
