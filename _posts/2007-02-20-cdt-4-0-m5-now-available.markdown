title: CDT 4.0 M5 Now Available

I am pleased to announce the availability of the first “public” milestone of CDT 4.0, M5. CDT 4.0 is going to be a huge release for us and bugzilla is telling me that we already have 265 bugs/enhancements that have been addressed (more than we did in all of CDT 3.1.0 BTW). With all the new committers working on it, it is important that we get these milestones out to the community for feedback and testing.

So feel free to give it a try. Instructions and links are available by following the CDT website, [http://www.eclipse.org/cdt](http://www.eclipse.org/cdt). Note that you require [Eclipse 3.3 M5](http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/drops/S-3.3M5-200702091006/index.php) to run it.

Unfortunately, we don’t have a New & Noteworthy. But things to look out for include new Views like the Include Browser, Call Hierarchy View, Type Hierarchy View, and improvement in performance for Open Declaration and Content Assist. The managed build internal builder works better by getting dependency info out of the index. There hasn’t been much change with debug and the standard builder.
