That’s about all I have to say about that. Eclipse is what you make of it. If you want change, get in, get your hands dirty, and make change happen. I’ve been able to do that over my years at Eclipse. We have a pretty decent C/C++ IDE thanks to the hard work of the community. We’ve been able to work with the platform team to push a number of changes down into the platform, debug especially, and now with the flexible resources, and more to come.

It is a lot of work, but then no one gets a free pass. If you’re passionate about helping with Eclipse’s success, you can make it happen, if you have the desire to work at it and work with our great community. If you are just going to complain about things from the sidelines, you shouldn’t expect much sympathy. And that’s all I have to say about that.
