I got a pointer to [this blog entry](http://marksitblog.blogspot.com/2007/07/tour-of-mysql-c-api.html) in my Google Alerts this morning. It’s an article on how to write a C application that talks to a MySQL database. And it’s done using the CDT. Very cool!

This is exactly the kind of article we need more of, showing the CDT in action solving real world problems. The CDT can be used for anything but a lot of people still don’t know that yet.
