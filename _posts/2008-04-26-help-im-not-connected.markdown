I mentioned a couple of weeks ago that I have this idea for a visual programming language with inspiration from UML Action Semantics and the SynthMaker virtual instrument programming environment that came with my Fruity Loops thing.

So on my flight down to San Fran for the Embedded Systems Conference last week, I thought I’d take a stab at learning GMF and maybe start plugging away at the idea. I haven’t used GMF recently and it looks like there’s a lot more automation these days that should help me get going quickly. I downloaded the new Modeling EPP package before I left and gave it a try.

Now, I learn best by walking through examples with the help of tutorials. I fired up the Help system and opened the page for GMF tutorials and it said: “A tutorial that covers the tooling and generative components of GMF is maintained on the GMF Wiki site here.” Uh, I’m on a plane. No tutorial for me. So I shut it down and did something else.

Again tonight, I go to start again and clicking the link I get: “Wiki.eclipse.org is currently down for maintenance. We apologize for the inconvenience, but expect to have the site back online shortly.” For crying out loud…
