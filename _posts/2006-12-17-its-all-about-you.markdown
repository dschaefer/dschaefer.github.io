According to Bjorn, [Eclipse is You](http://eclipse-projects.blogspot.com/2006/12/eclipse-is-you.html). Being on the receiving end of many “CDT doesn’t do <x>, or CDT is too slow doing <y>“, I couldn’t agree more. Say those words and you earn instant membership in the CDT community. And I appreciate every one of them, I actually do. It means you care and have spent the time to contribute your guidance to our collective knowledge. And it’s the first step down the path to contributing even more.</y></x>

Now, Time Magazine has selected the [Person of the Year](http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1569514,00.html), and it also happens to be You. Coincidence? I think not!
