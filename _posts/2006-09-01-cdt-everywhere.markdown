I continue to be surprised by how many vendors are redistributing the CDT with their products. Lately I’ve become interested in JTAG hardware debuggers and how to best hook them up to Eclipse for some real low level bit hacking debug workflows. This is something that probably deserves it’s own blog entry and it’s not really the theme of this story.

At any rate, I ran across a JTAG vendor called [Ronetix](http://www.ronetix.com/) who appears to build a pretty full featured device similar to the [Abatron](http://www.abatron.ch/) device I’ve been playing with lately. So quickly browsing Ronetix web site, I see that they have a Starter Kit that they sell. Low and behold it “Includes Eclipse IDE”. Going to the product page for the starter kit I see they have a [screenshot](http://ronetix.at/images/eclipse-cdt.jpg) of Eclipse in action, and, yes, it is the CDT.

At some point I need to sit down and figure out what is driving the success of the CDT. It certainly fills a need that maybe isn’t getting addressed by others, i.e., an IDE for non-Windows development that is extensible and ubiquitous (mind you I’m still keen on CDT for Windows development too). I’ll have to ask the 34 developers that are currently registered for the upcoming CDT Contributors Summit why they find the CDT important enough to invest in. No matter the reason, it’s been a fun ride and we’re looking forward to a great year of collaboration toward CDT 4.0.
