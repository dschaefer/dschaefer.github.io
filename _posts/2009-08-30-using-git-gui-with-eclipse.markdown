Here’s my next set of screencasts showing how I use git and git gui in particular with my Eclipse projects. There are two parts. The first shows how to set up a workspace based on a git clone repository, i.e. copying a remote repository to your local machine and setting up an Eclipse workspace for that repository. The second part is how I commit and push my changes to the remote server as I develop code. Hope this is useful.

BTW, This is best viewed by clicking on the YouTube link and watching it full screen in HD mode.
