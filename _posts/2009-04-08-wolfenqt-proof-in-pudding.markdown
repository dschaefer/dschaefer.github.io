An update to my previous post. As proof I got it working, here’s my blog from earlier today. You can’t see the flash since apparently the adobe flash player bypasses the widget set and opens a native window directly. Wonder where it showed up… At any rate, lots of fun. And with OpenGL mode turned on, performs quite nicely and the widgets are quite readable. Click on the picture to see full size. Very nice.
