Sounds like EclipseCon Europe was a huge success again. The feedback I have is that the sessions were very well received. We really have a good formula to follow and itâ€™s so important to the success of a conference that the community jumps on board and helps out by putting together some great sessions filled with information andÂ anecdotesÂ that the stick with the attendees as they head back to their workplaces. Aside from the camaraderie of being all together in one place, itâ€™s the sessions you remember most.

<div></div><div>Now itâ€™s time to look ahead to EclipseCon 2012 to be held in Reston, Virginia in the Washington D.C. area from March 26-29â€™th. The program committee and I have had a number of meetings over the last few months and weâ€™re ready to go. Itâ€™s going to be a lot of work going through all the great submissions I know the community is planning and itâ€™s going to be tough to make the best decisions. But we have plenty of past experience and community leaders on the committee and Iâ€™m confident itâ€™ll be good.</div><div></div><div>Please take note of the deadlines as they are fast approaching. The original deadline of November 11 is still there to help us select a small number of early bird sessions. These talks always get a little extra special attention so donâ€™t delay in getting your proposals in. Also the earlier you get your proposals in, the more time the program committee has to look at them. We are already forming opinions as the submissions role in. And donâ€™t forget the final deadline is November 18. Our task master Ian ðŸ˜‰ is pushing us really hard to get a program selected by December 1, so thereâ€™s no room for delay.</div><div></div><div>Submit yours today atÂ [http://eclipsecon.org](http://eclipsecon.org/)</div>
