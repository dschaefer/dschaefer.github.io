title: CDT 5.0 for Ganymede, Come get Some

CDT 5.0 is out the door and available at your friendly Ganymede update site. Iâ€™m sure the Eclipse servers will be busy the next few days. The Eclipse community is vast and they love trying out the shiny new features that weâ€™ve worked hard on all year to make.

Iâ€™m especially proud this year with CDT 5.0. With my new job at Wind River working on a p2 based installer, Iâ€™ve finally have a real reason to use it to write the JNI code that I need for some of the computation intensive parts of it. BTW, I now have proof that the Java version of an algorithm is much, much more compute intensive than a C version, check out the LZMA SDK from 7-Zip.

Iâ€™m really enjoying the experience. When I first imported the LZMA SDK into my C project, the first thing I needed to find out was where the main() function was. Letâ€™s try the Open Element dialog (Shift-Ctrl-T), typed in main, and there it was! A couple of Open Declarations (F3) later, and I was able to find the implementation of the decode function I needed to use. Awesome and I didnâ€™t even notice the Indexer running to find all this stuff. And everything else looked clean and worked well.

So yeah, the JDT guys are probably laughing since theyâ€™ve had all that stuff working well for a few years now. JDT has always been our bar (along with VisualStudio which I think we reached a while ago). But watch out. We may just make the CDT so good that people will wonder what the hype about Java was all about ðŸ™‚
