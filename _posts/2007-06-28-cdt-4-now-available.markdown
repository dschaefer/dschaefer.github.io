It’s been quite a year for the CDT. The growth of our community has been very rewarding. And CDT 4 is the fruit of our efforts. There are lots of new features and I counted 1152 bugs marked fixed. We have a What’s New section in our user docs that doubles as our traditional Eclipse New & Noteworthy. You can see it on the [Eclipse help machine](http://help.eclipse.org/help33/index.jsp?topic=/org.eclipse.cdt.doc.user/concepts/cdt_c_whatsnew.htm).

Download instructions are available on [our web site](http://www.eclipse.org/cdt) as well. There are lots of other ways to get it too. The Eclipse download site has the Eclipse Platform and the CDT in a single zip file. If you are on Linux, I’m sure you’ll see it soon in your favorite distribution. If you are on Windows and want to build Windows application with GNU tools, check my other announcement ;).
