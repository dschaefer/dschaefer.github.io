If you saw [Ken <span>Ryall’s</span> photo](http://nokiacarbideoneclipse.blogspot.com/2007/03/cdt-40-demo-at-eclipsecon.html), here’s from the other side of the room:

<div align="center">![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_EXDi_Vb_3_w/Re4LBNcuaxI/AAAAAAAAAAo/J5Yb5VIXLbo/s320/Demo.JPG)</div><div align="left">We had an overflow crowd for the CDT 4.0 demo. It’s pretty cool how much interest we seem to get in what we’re doing. The feedback was great and I think everyone was impressed with the work the team is doing. I’m totally excited about it and I hope that showed.</div><div align="left"></div><div align="left">I also participated in Robert Day’s panel on Eclipse in Embedded. Embedded continues to be one of the main growth areas with Eclipse and I think we concluded that we’re just scratching the surface. We really need to raise the profile of Eclipse in this market. The engineers see the value of <span>Eclipse</span> as a platform for embedded tooling and it’s unfortunate that isn’t common knowledge. We have our work cut out for us, but it would be great to get a huge contingent of embedded tools developers interested in attending <span>EclipseCon</span> next year and to get a bigger voice in Embedded marketing events like <span>ESC</span>.</div><div align="left">I’m also very tired. I don’t think I’ll stay in the bar until 2 a.m. this night…</div>
