Well, it’s all over. What a great week. For me and the CDT community, it was the best EclipseCon ever. We had plenty of talks about the CDT and really got our message out. We had a lot of time to talk to each other. The CDT demo and project meeting went really well. I also had a lot of time to talk to others in the greater Eclipse community about possible future integrations and maybe even some new projects down the line.

The morning of the last day started with the panel I moderated on multi-language support in Eclipse. A lot of interesting scenarios came up where users want to work with multiple languages at the same time which really stretches the bounds of what we’re doing. But it really shows that we need to work together more as Tools projects and the JDT to make sure that our plug-ins work together well and make it easier to create new language IDEs, maybe with the help of Safari.

The day concluded with the ending panel where Mike drilled the PMC leads for all the top level projects. I got to represent the Tools PMC and it was fun. One of the best suggestions I heard from the audience was that we really need to market the benefits for companies that put people to work on Eclipse projects. There are a lot of examples of companies that really do benefit financially by putting developers on Eclipse to make sure it meets their needs. We really need to showcase those examples to the world.

Anyway, it’s been a long week and I’m pretty tired. Time for bed…
