Iâ€™m here in Ludwigsburg, Germany already a day into my Eclipse Summit Europe experience. Iâ€™m glad Iâ€™m here. Looking at the CDT contributor community, Iâ€™d say we get half of our contributions from developers based in Europe. And given the number of people that have come up and introduced themselves to me, there is a lot of CDT interest here and it should be a busy week for me.

Iâ€™m watching Erich Gammaâ€™s talk as I type this. Heâ€™s giving a very refreshing look at the history of Eclipse and how we got here. Itâ€™s really a tribute to the vision from him and the gang at OTI that an effective development organization could form in the open source community. Weâ€™ve had our growing pains, but a number of projects are now thriving in this environment, especially IMHO the CDT.

I have my talk on CDT 4.0 later today and tonight we have a CDT BOF. I look forward to seeing who will be at the BOF and if youâ€™re here, please feel free to stop me and introduce yourself. Iâ€™m finding my picture on my blog is making easy for people to spot me ðŸ™‚
