It’s been a great first week at Wind River. I spent 3 of the first 4 hours there in conference calls which has given me a hint at how things are going to go. Wind is a very dispersed company and everything is managed over the phone, through IM and e-mail, and the occasional travel. It should be very dynamic and a really cool environment to insert myself into it.

And while that was going on, the debate raged in CDT-land over how to deal with projects sitting on top of file systems that may be spread all over hell’s acre. The good news is that we have a lot of momentum and all the right people in place looking at it and talking about it. I think EFS is the key and how well it works hiding away the details of the actually layout of the files and directories from the rest of the CDT and Eclipse in general will tell how well we succeed.

I’m going to spend some time over the Christmas holidays working on my flexible file system. I have a good idea of how to do it, I just need to sit down and get it done. Once I’m finished, I’m hoping it’ll work a lot like other major IDEs, Visual Studio included, and that you can add/exclude files and directories from anywhere your machine has access. And that should help us test all these other scenarios as well, including having your project distributed between machines.

It’s going to be cool stuff, and I’m sure other projects will be interested in it as well. Our challenge will be to engage them and make sure we come up with a solution that works well for all of the Eclipse community.
