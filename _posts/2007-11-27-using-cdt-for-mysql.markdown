title: Using CDT for MySQL

I recently got a note from a Hakan at MySQL who [wrote a tutorial](http://forge.mysql.com/wiki/Eclipse/CDT_on_Linux_and_Mac_OS_X) on how to use the CDT to build and debug a component of MySQL called Falcon. I’m always glad to see when other open source communities have found the CDT useful for their work. It’s one of the best ways to show publicly the different capabilities of the CDT, and its a lot easier to get co-operation between open communities.

The tutorial shows MySQL being debugged on a Mac. I didn’t realize how slick the CDT looked in that environment. And I guess I didn’t realize that MySQL ran on a Mac, but it makes sense that it does. And it really shows the value of the CDT for cross platform development. They follow the same steps on Linux. Now if we could do Windows just as easily…
