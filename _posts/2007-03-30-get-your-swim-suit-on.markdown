A colleague pointed this out to me and it really made my day. With the stress of getting CDT 4.0 M6 out the door while getting ready for a week at ESC, you need to have a laugh to help keep you going.

Here’s what you do. Go to [Google maps](http://maps.google.com/maps) and click get directions. Start from somewhere in North America and end somewhere in Europe.

The directions will guide you to Long Wharf in Boston and then instruct you to “Swim across the Atlantic Ocean”, which apparently is 5572 kilometers. You then get out of the water in La Havre, France, and continue on your way.

I love the sense of humour software developers have. I can imagine the design discussions around putting this feature in. I’m sure they’re still laughing about it, just like we are now. Now, what can we do with the CDT, hmm…
