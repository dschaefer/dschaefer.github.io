title: Eclipse Board Election Under Way

Itâ€™s been a quiet campaign, I guess, at least relative to other elections that are going on right now. Thanks to Ed Merks who we can always expect to stir up the pot ðŸ™‚ We did end up have a really healthy debate over the way the Committer reps are elected. One thing weâ€™re not short of at Eclipse is passionate contributors and thatâ€™s good for everyone concerned.

I encourage all the committers to take the time to vote. Itâ€™s a pretty complicated ballot and voting scheme and the choices are pretty hard to make since all the candidates are worthy or representing you. I think the next couple of years are going to be critical for Eclipse as contributing vendors shift their investment. We need to make sure the board does what it can to help ensure the continued success of the projects and of the vendors that contribute to and adopt the works of those projects. So make sure you vote for the person who you think can best represent youâ€™re needs.

I have no idea how Iâ€™m going to fare since my campaign budget didnâ€™t allow for any polling ;), but Iâ€™m glad I had the opportunity to share my vision for Eclipse and will continue to work with whoever gets elected to help turn that vision into a reality. Iâ€™m not sure weâ€™ll get CNN to cover the results, but itâ€™ll be fun to see how it all unfolds.
