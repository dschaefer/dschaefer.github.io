So you know in Bugzilla you can mark a bug as a duplicate of another bug. I have no problem with people raising new bugs even if they end up being duplicates of another bug. That way we make sure we get them all.

But I’ve often run into cases where I’d like to mark that a bug “conflicts with” another bug. If you mark one of them FIXED, the other one automatically gets marked INVALID.

The tough part, though, is picking the one to fix…
