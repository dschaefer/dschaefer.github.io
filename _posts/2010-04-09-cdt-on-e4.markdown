title: CDT on e4

I just got word of the available e4 Eclipse SDK test builds and thought I’d try out the CDT on it. The great news is that I had no build errors for the CDT base functionality (haven’t tried our advanced debug views yet). And I was able to create a C++ project and build it. I had issues going into debug, but I am pretty happy on how far it has come.

There’s still a lot missing, though, so there is much work ahead. And as I’ve feared the UI performance is quite bad, but there’s a long way to go to clean these things up. I’ll be keeping regular tabs on their progress and test as many of the CDT workflows as I can as the platform stabilizes.

Here’s a teaser screenshot.
