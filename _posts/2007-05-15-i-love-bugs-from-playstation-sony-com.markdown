I have no idea what this group is doing with the CDT. They’ve been on the outskirts of our community for quite a while and [this bug](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=108439) was just marked VERIFIED to show they are still around. In fact, one of my first experiences as a CDT “dude” was at the first EclipseCon where someone from the Sony Playstation group stopped Sebastien, the first CDT project lead, and I and asked us for information about CDT extensibility. We thought it was pretty cool then, and it’s still cool now.
