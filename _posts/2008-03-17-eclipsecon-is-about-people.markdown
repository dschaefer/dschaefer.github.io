I finally headed up to my hotel room to finish going through the CDT Build tutorial. I think I’m ready, wish me luck.

I was having way too much fun meeting people and catching up with the CDT crowd. That’s what this event is all about for me. There’s lots of talks I want to go to and learn some of the new areas of Eclipse that I haven’t been involved in. But I may end up just sitting in the power lounge meeting people, discussing CDT and Eclipse issues, and just enjoying being a part of this great think called Eclipse.
