title: Eclipse vs VS on Slashdot

A pointer to an article comparing Visual Studio and Eclipse has been [posted to Slashdot](http://it.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/09/02/1937247). The article isn’t really strong, but I am finding a ton of value reading the comments on Slashdot. The people there make a lot of good points and there is even some discussion on the CDT.

It’s interesting to see that the number of pro-Eclipse versus pro-VS comments is pretty even. One thing that I did pick up from it for Eclipse, other than a bunch of usability concerns, is that if we truely want to be compared to VS, Eclipse really needs to support .Net development. That and we really need a GUI builder. I wish I had more time to [take a look at NAB](http://www.eclipse.org/dsdp/nab/) and see if we can use it more generally as the NAB team suggests.
