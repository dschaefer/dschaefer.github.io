I’m not going to say much with this one. I’ll just refer you to the comments people are adding to [Boris’s blog entry on his work with Mozilla](http://borisoneclipse.blogspot.com/2009/02/eclipse-in-cloud.html) to get an experimental IDE running in a browser with an Eclipse-based server back-end. Is this what developers working in the embedded and desktop space are asking for? Not that I’ve heard. And neither do a number of the commenters on Boris’s article. Some of them are putting it in much prettier words than I could say without getting into trouble…

That’s why it is so critical for those of us in the Eclipse community who support such users to make sure Eclipse continues to work well and to improve in the areas that cause them pain. Is the future of enterprise development so different from desktop and embedded that it requires such radical architectures? Maybe so. If that’s true, we need to hold our ground and ensure we don’t get dragged down a path we can’t be going.
