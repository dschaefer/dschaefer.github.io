title: Using CDT for Android Native

Android has a native development kit (NDK) which can be used to create JNI native code for Android applications. In this video, I show how I convert an Android project in Eclipse to add the C/C++ nature to it and set it up to build the shared library that gets included in your Android apk file. This gives you all the power of the CDT in combination with the JDT to build Android apps with native code. Except for debug, though, as JNI debug remains the lost holy grail for the CDTâ€¦

If you want to look at the code from the demo, you can clone or download from [http://github.com/dschaefer/androidDemo](http://github.com/dschaefer/androidDemo).
