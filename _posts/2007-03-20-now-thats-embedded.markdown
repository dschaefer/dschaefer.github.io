I ran across this [really cool project](http://energizerrack.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns!7D224A26F2501237!177.entry) this morning. A guy built a little device that recorded light patterns, i.e. bright/dark, and then replayed them on an LED. He used a tiny Atmel micro controller and programmed it in C using, you guessed it, the CDT, with the [WinAVR](http://winavr.sourceforge.net/) cross compiler toolchain.

Itâ€™s projects like this that make working on the CDT so cool. We have this little device with 1K flash and 64 bytes, yes bytes!, of RAM and people can use the CDT to program it. Then we have the big iron supercomputers that the [Parallel Tools Project](http://www.eclipse.org/ptp) gang work with, and you can use the CDT to program it as well. And, of course everything in between, from mobile multi-media devices, to Linux server applications, to the PC desktop, to gaming consoles. But this little project really made my day!
