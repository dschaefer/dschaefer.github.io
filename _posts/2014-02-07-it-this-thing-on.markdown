Hey gang. I’ve switched my blog to my own website, http://cdtdoug.ca. I’ve been quiet in the blogosphere but many of you follow me on twitter. I just found it a great way to get quick ideas out of my head and onto paper. But I have a few exciting projects I’m working on for Eclipse and I just can’t do them justice in Twitter. So stay tuned for more on my work with Eclipse on JavaFX, Qt support in CDT, UX improvements with a launch configurations toolbar and a new new project wizard, and more…
