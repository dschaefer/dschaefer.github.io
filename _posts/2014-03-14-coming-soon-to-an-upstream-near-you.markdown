I use the new upcoming Momentics IDE for my everyday work with all Eclipse projects Iâ€™m working on. Our new updated toolbar supports it all. Pick your launch mode, launch configuration, and target you want to run on, click Build, Launch, Stop. Boom!

Nothing like a little dog food to make a user experience you love to use. Weâ€™re still tweaking this as we run into workflows that we hate.

And, yes, we intend to contribute this upstream to Eclipse somewhere. Iâ€™ll be showing and discussing this at the CDT Summit and to anyone at EclipseCon who wants to see it in action.
