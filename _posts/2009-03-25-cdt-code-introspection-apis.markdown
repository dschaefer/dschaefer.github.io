I’m just sitting in Markus’s talk on the APIs the CDT provides to create code models, ASTs, the Indexer and ways of getting information out of there. These facilities are used to implement features such as content assist and open declaration and searching, etc. And you can use it too for all your static analysis needs. A copy of his presentation is available from the EclipseCon site by following the link to gPublication. It’s a great reference on how to get started.
