title: Eclipse versus Emacs, a battle unfinished

I was watching a presentation and someone was talking about integrating gdb with Emacs and showed a screenshot of it in action. I was at the back of the room and I had to squint, because when i first saw it, I swore it was Eclipse.

In this day in age of Eclipse having every feature of Emacs, save a good scripting and keystroke record/playback story, why would anyone still be using Emacs?

Well, of course, you’d be foolish to think that everyone using Emacs is just going to drop it and jump on the Eclipse bandwagon. And there are still some major technical hurdles that force you to be sympathetic with them.

And this is the challenge we face, especially in the technical and embedded space where the CDT is most popular. Eclipse is too big, too slow to start, and the UI too complex and unless we start addressing some of this, it’s still going to be a fight to get these users to buy into our story. There is a lot of value to the extensibility and integration story we are selling, but if the barrier to get Joe and Jane developer to even start the thing is too high, it’s no good.

With all the talk about e4 and new architectures for the new world going on, we also really need to take a long look at how we can finally beat Emacs. Yes, I’m CDT Doug, but I still use XEmacs on Windows as my main text editor, even to look at C++ files outside of workspaces. I shouldn’t have to, you’d think…
