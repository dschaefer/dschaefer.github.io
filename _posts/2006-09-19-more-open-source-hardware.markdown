title: More Open Source Hardware

I’ve got Google Alerts notifying me when something comes up with Eclipse CDT and another one for Eclipse embedded. I’m starting to get a few of these a week, including two today. One came from [Lattice Semiconductor](http://www.latticesemi.com/). What was noteworthy in this case was they were also open sourcing the design for their 32-bit microcontroller. Now these guys are a lot smaller than Sun who [open sourced the design](http://cdtdoug.blogspot.com/2006/09/open-source-hardware.html) for their Niagara 8-core Sparc chip. But I’m starting to wonder if there really is a trend happening here.

If this means we’ll see more people customizing chip designs using hardware description languages and building the software that will run on them, then Eclipse is an obvious host for this kind of hardware/software codesign activity.
